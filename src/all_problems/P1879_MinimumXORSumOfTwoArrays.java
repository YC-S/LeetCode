    // This method requires the use of dynamic programming.
    // Notice that since n is small, we can use bitwise operations to observe quickly which elements
    // in nums2 have been chosen so far.
    // So for example if nums2 has 3 elements, we can use 100 to denote the 1st item in nums2 was
    // chosen,
    // 010 to denote the 2nd item in nums2 was chosen, 001 to denote the 3rd item was chosen, etc.

    // Firstly, we calculate all the possible XOR values and store into the HashMap shown here.
    HashMap<Integer, HashMap<Integer, Integer>> map = new HashMap<>();
    int n = nums1.length;

    // We also set up the dp matrix. The row number indicates which index in nums1 we are looking at
    // now.
    // The col number indicates the bitwise notation as explained earlier. The largest possible
    // bitwise notation is (1<<n)-1
    // Why? Because if we have 3 elements, that means that largest possible notation we can get is
    // 111 (all 3 elements in nums2 have been chosen already)
    // (1<<n)-1 is a shorthand to give the value 111
    // Since we are finding the minimum value, we preset everything to Infinity

      }
    }

    // This is the place where I calculate all the possible XOR values and store into the HashMap.
    // The key of this map is which index I am currently in inside nums1 array.
    // The nested HashMap<Integer,Integer> has the bitwise notation as its key, and the XOR value as
    // its value.

      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        if (j == 0) map.put(i, new HashMap<>());
        int temp = nums1[i] ^ nums2[j];
        map.get(i).put((1 << j), temp);

        // Here, I am just saying that just by looking at index 0 of nums1 array, I can find the
        // best possible result so far.
        // Since this method iterates in order (index 0 --> index 1 --> index 2 of nums1 array) to
        // find the best result at each step,
        // it means that the best possible result so far just by looking at index 0 of nums1 array,
        // is every possible combination
        // with the nums2 array. Hence, we can just initialize these values for all possible
        // combinations with the index 0 of nums1
        if (i == 0) dp[i][(1 << j)] = temp;
      }
    }

    // Finally, our dp!
    // If the value is Infinity, it means we haven't found our best solution for that yet. Skip!
    // Otherwise, we check the HashMap at the next index of nums1 array.
    // Complete search through all the possible bitwise notations, to find all the possible 'next
    // steps'.
    // Remember the bitwise notation stored in the HashMap each has exactly one zero only, to denote
    // which item in nums2 I had chosen.
    // A 'next step' is possible if the bitwise notation and my current col number do NOT have any
    // overlaps.
    // If there are overlaps, it means that I had chosen that particular element in nums2 array
    // before, and I should not do anything.
    // So, we can use (bitwise notation & j) == 0 to check if there are NO overlaps
    // Only if there are no overlaps, we can find the next best state in our dp. We can do (bitwise
    // notation|j) to combine those two together (so basically, adding a 1 into our col number) and
    // then modifying the result using the classical Math.min method

    for (int i = 0; i < dp.length - 1; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < dp[0].length; j++) {
        if (dp[i][j] == Integer.MAX_VALUE) continue;
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map2 = map.get(i + 1);
        for (int bitcode : map2.keySet()) {
          if ((bitcode & j) == 0) {
            dp[i + 1][bitcode | j] = Math.min(dp[i + 1][bitcode | j], dp[i][j] + map2.get(bitcode));
          }
        }
      }
    }

    // Our answer lies in this particular region, where we are looking at index n-1 of nums1 array
    // (the end of the array), as well
    // as having chosen ALL elements in nums2 array (given by 111111 depending on the value of n)
    // which is simply (1<<n)-1 as explained above.

    // This question is similar to question 1799, where I employed a similar approach.
